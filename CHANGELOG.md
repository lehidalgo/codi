# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Node engine requirement lowered from `>=24` to `>=20.19.0`** — the codi-cli runtime uses only `structuredClone` (Node 17+), `fetch` (Node 18+), and other APIs available since Node 20. The previous `>=24` floor produced an `EBADENGINE` warning for every Node 20 / 22 LTS user even though `codi` ran correctly on those versions. tsup `target` lowered from `node24` to `node20` to match. Documentation (`README.md`, `docs/project/getting-started.md`, `docs/project/troubleshooting.md`, `docs/src/content/docs/guides/getting-started.md`) updated to state the new minimum. The curl installer still installs Node 24 (latest LTS) for users who don't manage their own Node.

### Changed

- **`exceljs` and `pptxgenjs` moved from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`** — both packages are imported only by skill template scripts (`src/templates/skills/xlsx/scripts/ts/generate_xlsx.ts`, `src/templates/skills/pptx/scripts/ts/generate_pptx.ts`) that run inside the user's project after scaffolding, never by the CLI runtime (`src/cli.ts` / `src/index.ts`). End users running `npm install -g codi-cli` now skip 91 transitive packages and 6 deprecation warnings (`fstream`, `glob@7`, `inflight`, `lodash.isequal`, `rimraf@2`, `uuid@8`) inherited from the legacy `archiver@5` / `unzipper@0.10` dep chains. Users who run the bundled TypeScript generators must install the packages in their own project first: `npm install exceljs` or `npm install pptxgenjs`. The `codi-xlsx` and `codi-pptx` skill READMEs document this prerequisite.
- **CI workflows migrated from npm to pnpm** — `.github/workflows/{ci,release,pages}.yml` now use `pnpm/action-setup@v4`, `cache: pnpm` on `actions/setup-node`, and `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Matches the project's canonical package manager. `npm publish --provenance` is retained in `release.yml` (the npm CLI publishes pnpm projects without modification). `node -p 'require(...)'` patterns replaced with `jq` (preinstalled on `ubuntu-latest`).

### Removed

- **`package-lock.json`** — pnpm is the canonical package manager (`pnpm-lock.yaml` is the source of truth). The stale `package-lock.json` (last seen at version 2.12.0) was deleted to prevent drift between two lockfile formats.

## [2.14.0] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **Per-language pre-commit hooks no longer lint vendored agent content** in `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/`, `.cline/`. The YAML `exclude:` regex previously covered only `.codi/`; the six other agent dirs are now part of a single source of truth (`src/core/hooks/exclusions.ts`) consumed by both the YAML renderer and the file-size check template.
- **Pre-commit YAML insertion no longer corrupts `.pre-commit-config.yaml`** when the project already had `repos:` entries with nested `hooks:` lists. The legacy text-based renderer (`findReposInsertionPoint`) overwrote `listIndent` on every nested list item, causing the generated Codi block to land **inside** the external repo's `hooks:` list and produce invalid YAML. The function now locks `listIndent` to the first list item it encounters under `repos:` and never reassigns it. The renderer was subsequently superseded by a YAML AST round-trip implementation (see Changed).

### Changed

- **Pre-commit framework runner emits canonical upstream `repo:` references with pinned `rev:` and `additional_dependencies` where required** — `astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit`, `pre-commit/mirrors-mypy`, `PyCQA/bandit`, `pre-commit/mirrors-prettier`, `gitleaks/gitleaks`, `alessandrojcm/commitlint-pre-commit-hook`, `koalaman/shellcheck-precommit`. Codi's own `.mjs` scripts remain `repo: local`. Users now get isolated tool envs, `pre-commit autoupdate` compatibility, and proper version pinning out of the box.
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml` write path is now a YAML AST round-trip via the `yaml` package** — Codi-managed entries carry a `# managed by codi` comment marker on their `repo:` line. On regeneration: non-marked entries pass through untouched, marked entries are rebuilt from the registry, and **user-edited `rev:` pins on marked entries are preserved**. Malformed YAML triggers a `.pre-commit-config.yaml.codi-backup` write before regeneration. Idempotent: re-running with no changes produces byte-identical output and skips the write.
- **Default Python type checker is now `basedpyright`** (PyPI wheel, no npm dependency) when no project signals point elsewhere. Auto-detection picks `mypy` when `[tool.mypy]` / `mypy.ini` / Django / SQLAlchemy / `django-stubs` is present, `basedpyright` for FastAPI / pydantic / SQLModel projects or codebases over 20k Python LOC. The previous default was `npx pyright`, which forced an npm dependency on pure-Python repos.
- **Type-checking (`tsc`, `mypy`, `basedpyright`, `pyright`, `dotnet-build`, `phpstan`) and full test suites default to `pre-push` stage** instead of `pre-commit`. Override via the new `commit_type_check` / `commit_test_run` flags or by editing `.codi/flags.yaml` directly. Industry consensus is to keep commits under 5s; the upstream `pre-commit` project explicitly rejects pytest as a pre-commit hook.
- **Bandit invoked with `-lll` (high severity only)** by default and `additional_dependencies: ["bandit[toml]"]` so `[tool.bandit]` configuration in `pyproject.toml` works without separate setup. Install hint corrected to `pip install "bandit[toml]"`.
- **Prettier scope expanded** to `**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs,json,md,mdx,yaml,yml,css,scss,html}` (was `*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`).
- **Generated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes top-level keys**: `default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit, commit-msg, pre-push]`, `default_language_version: {python: python3.12, node: '22'}`, `minimum_pre_commit_version: '3.5.0'`, and a global `exclude:` derived from the `VENDORED_DIRS` SSoT (see Fixed entry above). Existing user values are never overwritten.
- **Hook registry split into per-language modules** under `src/core/hooks/registry/` (one file per language plus `global.ts` and a barrel `index.ts`). `src/core/hooks/hook-registry.ts` becomes a thin backward-compat shim. New `HookSpec` shape replaces flat `HookEntry` (`HookEntry` retained as a type alias). Each spec carries explicit `shell` and `preCommit` emission descriptors so each renderer reads its own field instead of sharing ambiguous fields.

### Added

- **Conflict-marker detection** in `codi validate` and as a new global pre-commit hook (`conflict-marker-check`). `validate` scans rule, skill, and agent content for `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` / `|||||||` (diff3) markers and emits `E_CONFLICT_MARKERS` with file and line. The pre-commit hook script (`codi-conflict-marker-check.mjs`) blocks commits containing markers in any non-binary staged file. Both consumers share a pure scanner in `src/core/hooks/conflict-markers.ts`.
- **`codi doctor --hooks`** mode that lists per-hook tool availability with severity (ok / warning / error), category, and install hint. Exits non-zero if any required hook tool is missing. Uses the existing `checkHookDependencies` infrastructure; complements `installMissingDeps` which runs at `codi init` time.
- **Batched install hints in `installMissingDeps`**: missing pip / brew / gem / go / cargo / rustup tools are now grouped into single commands per package manager (`pip install ruff pyright` instead of two separate fragments). cargo and rustup are kept as separate groups since rustup components are not crates.
- **Four new tooling-default flags**, all with default value `auto`:
  - `python_type_checker`: `auto | mypy | basedpyright | pyright | off`
  - `js_format_lint`: `auto | eslint-prettier | biome | off`
  - `commit_type_check`: `auto | on | off` (default resolves to `off` — defer to pre-push)
  - `commit_test_run`: `auto | on | off` (default resolves to `off` — industry default)

  `auto` is resolved at `codi init` / `codi generate` time by `src/core/hooks/auto-detection.ts`, which reads `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json` (deps + workspaces signal), counts python/ts/js LOC, and probes for `mypy.ini`, `pyrightconfig.json`, `biome.json`, `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`. The four flags are added to all six builtin presets (minimal, balanced, strict, fullstack, development, power-user).

- **Biome registry entry** as the alternative to eslint+prettier for JS/TS lint and format. Upstream hook is `biomejs/pre-commit` v0.6.1 with `additionalDependencies: ["@biomejs/biome@2.3.0"]`. When `js_format_lint=biome` is set, the hook-config-generator drops eslint and prettier from the spec list and emits the Biome `biome-check --write` hook instead.

- **Interactive wizard summary screen** at the end of `codi init`. After language detection, Codi shows the four auto-resolved tooling defaults with their reasoning signals, then offers `Accept (Enter)` / `Customize each` / `Skip pre-commit hooks entirely`. Customize walks one prompt per flag with the auto-pick pre-highlighted; Skip bypasses hook installation entirely. The accepted picks are merged into `.codi/flags.yaml` so subsequent `codi generate` runs honour them.

- **Commitlint global hook** (`alessandrojcm/commitlint-pre-commit-hook` with `additionalDependencies: [@commitlint/config-conventional]`) wired to the `commit-msg` stage, gated by the existing commit-msg-validation infrastructure.

- **Polyglot integration test** (`tests/integration/hook-install-precommit.test.ts`) covering: TS+Python managed-entries emission, migration from the legacy text-marker block, user-pinned `rev:` preservation, and malformed-YAML backup behaviour.

- **E2E test** (`tests/e2e/precommit-multilanguage.test.ts`) that pipes the rendered config through `pre-commit validate-config`. Auto-skipped when `pre-commit` is not on PATH; CI now installs it via `pip install pre-commit` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### Migration

On first `codi generate` after upgrading, Codi:

1. Strips any legacy `# Codi hooks: BEGIN ... END` text-marker block from your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (and the older column-zero broken form).
2. If your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is malformed, copies it to `.pre-commit-config.yaml.codi-backup` and rewrites from scratch.
3. Re-emits Codi-managed entries with the new layout (upstream `repo:` references for canonical tools, pinned `rev:`, top-level keys). Your manually-edited `rev:` values on Codi-managed entries are preserved.

The four new flags default to `auto` — existing projects do not need to set them. To override the auto-resolved values, either run the interactive wizard during `codi init` (Customize / Skip options) or edit `.codi/flags.yaml` directly between runs.

- **Hub: "Customize codi setup" entry** — when `.codi/` exists, the first hub entry now reads "Customize codi setup" and routes directly into the modify menu, skipping the previous "Force reinitialize? Yes/No" prompt that hid the modify-mode wizard. When `.codi/` is absent, the entry stays "Initialize project". Selecting "Customize codi setup" opens a top-level dispatcher: customize current artifacts, add from local directory / ZIP / GitHub repo, or replace preset (advanced).
- **Add artifacts from external source** — new workflow under "Customize codi setup". Connect to a local directory, ZIP file, or public GitHub repository; codi walks the source for `rules/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `mcp-servers/` and lists every artifact found. Per-type sequential multi-select (Rules → Skills → Agents → MCP servers) matching the regular init wizard's pattern. Per-collision prompts (keep current / overwrite / rename with `-from-<source>` suffix) with an "apply to remaining" affordance. Externally-added artifacts are recorded in `artifact-manifest.json` with `managedBy: user` and a new `source:` provenance field, so subsequent `codi update` runs leave them untouched.
- **Depth-aware preset discovery** — `findArtifactRoots` walks the source tree up to 2 levels deep, so a GitHub-zip layout like `repo-name/{rules,skills,…}` or a multi-preset bundle like `repo-name/{preset-a,preset-b}/{rules,skills,…}` is discovered automatically. When multiple candidate presets are found in one source, the user is prompted to pick one. Skips dotfiles, `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`.
- **Init: "Import from local directory" option** — the regular `codi init` wizard's Configuration step now offers the same external-source import as `Customize codi setup`. Picking it routes through the artifact-selection workflow (skips the preset-style installer for local paths, since they are user-pointed paths rather than packaged presets).
- **Init: artifact-selection fallback for ZIP / GitHub without `preset.yaml`** — when the regular preset-style installer fails because the source has no `preset.yaml` (community bundles like `codi-presets-main.zip`), codi now re-attempts via the same artifact-selection workflow rather than silently falling back to the default preset.
- **Auto-generate after Add from external** — `runAddFromExternal` now triggers `regenerateConfigs(projectRoot)` automatically when at least one artifact is installed. Falls back to a clear "run codi generate manually" warning if auto-generate fails. The user no longer has to type `codi generate` after every external import.
- **Curl installer** — one-liner install at `https://lehidalgo.github.io/codi/install.sh` that detects the host environment and installs nvm + Node 24 if missing, then runs `npm install -g codi-cli`. Avoids the EACCES failure mode that hits users with system-managed Node on `/usr/local`. Honors `CODI_VERSION`, `CODI_INSTALL_NVM`, `CODI_DRY_RUN`, `CODI_NO_COLOR` overrides. Published checksum at `install.sh.sha256` for verification. Hosted via the existing GitHub Pages deploy.

### Changed

- **Generate respects the project's configured agents** — `codi hub` → "Generate configs" now lists and pre-selects only the agents declared in `.codi/codi.yaml`'s `agents:` field, instead of always offering all six registered adapters. Unknown adapters in the manifest are skipped with a warning. If the manifest is unreadable, falls back to all-adapters with a warning. If zero usable agents are configured, errors out before prompting.
- **GitHub URL parser uses canonical resolver** — the "Add from GitHub" flow now resolves the repo via `parsePresetIdentifier` (the same parser the rest of the CLI uses), so it accepts every form codi accepts elsewhere: `org/repo`, `org/repo@v1.2.0`, `github:org/repo#branch`, `https://github.com/org/repo[.git]`, and `https://github.com/org/repo/tree/branch`. Bare `org/repo` no longer fails with "Not a GitHub identifier".
- **Welcome banner now renders inside a rounded box** — the ASCII logo, tagline + version, and Stack/Agents status lines are framed with `╭─...─╮` borders (matching the Codex CLI visual style). Auto-sizes to the widest content line. Falls back to the un-boxed layout on terminals narrower than the box width.
- **Artifact manifest schema** — `ArtifactEntry` gained an optional `source` field (e.g. `"github:org/repo@ref"`, `"zip:bundle.zip"`, `"local:/abs/path"`). Additive — existing manifests parse unchanged.

### Fixed

- **`npm version` now ships the tag in the same step** — `postversion` script switched from bare `git push` to `git push --follow-tags`. Previously every release required a manual `git push origin vX.Y.Z` follow-up, or the tag stayed local-only.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot support (6th agent platform)** — `codi generate` now emits `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, path-scoped `.github/instructions/{name}.instructions.md`, VS Code Prompt Files in `.github/prompts/`, Agent Skills in `.github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, custom agents in `.github/agents/{name}.agent.md`, MCP config at `.vscode/mcp.json`, and heartbeat hooks via `.github/hooks/codi-hooks.json`. Supports both Copilot Chat (IDE) and Copilot CLI / Coding Agent (Agent Skills) in a dual-format single pass.
- **`sanitizeNameForPath()` shared utility** — single source of truth for adapter-level filename sanitization across all 6 adapters; prevents path traversal via artifact names (`../`, `/`, special chars).
- **Adapter-derived `codi clean`** — `AGENT_SUBDIRS` / `AGENT_FILES` / `knownFiles` now derived from `ALL_ADAPTERS` so new adapters auto-register for cleanup. `isSafeSubdir` guard prevents recursive deletion of the project root when an adapter declares `paths.rules = "."` (Codex).
- **content-factory — plan-first operating system** — six-phase validation-gated workflow (Discovery → Master → Validation → Planning → Validation → Generation) with Markdown anchor, Markdown variant plans, and HTML rendering only after explicit user approval
- **content-factory — platform subfolder structure** — `content/{linkedin,instagram,facebook,tiktok,x,blog,deck}/` scaffolded per project with per-platform playbooks and traversal-safe path resolution
- **content-factory — My Work tab** — promoted from Gallery filter to top-level tab
- **content-factory — external-skill soft deps** — integration with `marketingskills`, `claude-blog`, `claude-seo`, `banana-claude`
- **content-factory — UI polish** — format picker gated by type, preview-bar card controls, scrollable filmstrip, 3× export resolution, default light palette
- **`codi generate` prunes orphaned files** — files that were generated in a previous run but are no longer present in the source templates are now automatically deleted. Files with local edits are preserved unless `--on-conflict keep-incoming` (or `--force`) is passed. Implemented via new `StateManager.detectOrphans()` + `deleteOrphans()` methods with unit test coverage.
- **`codi update --on-conflict <strategy>`** — `codi update` now accepts the same `keep-current` / `keep-incoming` strategies as `codi generate` for non-interactive conflict resolution.
- **`--on-conflict` flag** — `codi init` and `codi generate` accept `--on-conflict keep-current|keep-incoming` to control conflict resolution in non-interactive/CI mode; `--force` remains an alias for `keep-incoming`
- **heartbeat hooks** — `codi generate` writes `codi-skill-tracker.cjs` and `codi-skill-observer.cjs` to `.codi/hooks/` and wires them into `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json`
- **skill-observer** — Stop hook extracts `[CODI-OBSERVATION: ...]` markers from the transcript and writes feedback JSON to `.codi/feedback/`
- **skill-tracker** — InstructionsLoaded hook records active Codi skills to `.codi/.session/active-skills.json`
- **core-platform** — all 6 built-in presets now include the self-improvement rule and 5 self-improvement skills by default (verification, session-recovery, rule-feedback, refine-rules, compare-preset)
- **refine-rules** — two-mode skill (REVIEW + REFINE) that reads `.codi/feedback/` and edits rule files with approval
- **brand-creator** — new skill replacing `brand-identity`; generates brand skills with `brand/tokens.json` (themes, fonts, assets, voice)
- **content-factory** — brand API endpoints (`/api/brands`, `/api/active-brand`) and brand template support
- **content-factory** — campaign pipeline: `/api/active-card`, `/api/brief`, brief-driven variant propagation, promote-to-template workflow
- **manifest** — `project_context` field: free-form markdown injected into the AI instruction file
- **generate** — auto-injects self-development mode warning into CLAUDE.md when `manifest.name === "codi"`
- **skill READMEs** — setup guides added for 17 complex skills

### Changed

- **skills consolidation (66 → 60)** — six merges collapse redundant skills while preserving all functionality:
  - `skill-feedback-reporter` absorbed into `refine-rules` as REVIEW mode
  - `session-handoff` + `daily-log` → `session-log` (HANDOFF / LOG / RESUME modes, markdown journal in `docs/sessions/`)
  - `diagnostics` absorbed into `debugging` as Phase 5 (MCP-powered deep diagnosis)
  - `test-run` + `test-coverage` → `test-suite` (RUN / COVERAGE / GENERATE modes)
  - `plan-executor` + `subagent-dev` → `plan-execution` (INLINE / SUBAGENT modes, always asks user)
  - `doc-engine` absorbed into `content-factory` (business documents as a reference template)
- **rule-feedback** — `user-invocable: false`; uses `[CODI-OBSERVATION: ...]` markers instead of writing JSON files
- **improvement rule** — agent emits observation markers instead of writing files; max 3 per session
- **settings.json** — always generated; always includes heartbeat hook wiring
- **content-factory** — named project workspace, export stack, DOCX fidelity improvements, A4 page discipline

### Fixed

- **`codi generate` / `codi update` — conflict flag name collision** — `GenerateOptions` and `ConflictOptions` used a misnamed `json` field that meant "skip conflicts silently", colliding with the CLI's global `--json` output flag. Passing `--json` for JSON output silently activated skip-conflicts mode, causing unintended preservation of stale files. Renamed to `keepCurrent` throughout the codebase. The CLI's `--json` flag now controls output format only; `--on-conflict keep-current` controls conflict behavior independently.
- **content-factory — per-file type inference** — preview header derives type/canvas from the active file's card class, not the project-level preset
- **content-factory — subfolder path handling** — content/session-content/persist-style routes accept relative paths like `linkedin/carousel.html` with a path-traversal guard
- **content-factory — gallery grid renders empty when templates load after gallery init** — force rebuild after `loadTemplates()` resolves
- **conflict resolver** — unresolvable conflict data in non-TTY mode now writes to stderr instead of stdout, preventing raw JSON from polluting piped output
- **conflict resolver error message** — `UnresolvableConflictError` hint now references `--on-conflict keep-incoming` / `--on-conflict keep-current` instead of the misleading `--force` / `--json` pair.
- **heartbeat hooks** — use `.cjs` extension so CommonJS `require()` works in ESM projects
- **run-eval** — creates temp skills in `.claude/skills/` instead of deprecated `.claude/commands/`
- **settings.json hooks** — wrap hook commands in `{ matcher, hooks: [...] }` objects to match Claude Code's required format
- **wizard pre-selection** — custom path no longer pre-selects all rules and agents; only Codi Platform artifacts are pre-selected by default across all paths

### Added (docs site)

- **search** — results now show artifact type badge (skill/rule/agent/preset) and file path hint
- **search** — matched terms highlighted in excerpts via Pagefind's `<mark>` tags
